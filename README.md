# spotifyguesser.io

The purpose of this project is to practice React.js and API fetching using Spotify's API.

The goal of the game is to guess the given songs, and the more songs you are able to guess, the higher score you will receive.

### Familiarized myself with:
- React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
- Asynchronous API (async/await)
- JSX, components, css modules, etc.

(React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

### To try the game yourself, you need to...
- Firstly, open your favourite code editor (I used Visual Studio Code)
- Then, clone the repository by entering the following into your terminal:
<blockquote>

git clone https://github.com/rayzhou4/spotifyguesser.io.git
</blockquote>

- Afterwards, install the required packages by entering:
<blockquote>

    npm install

    npm install npm-run-all --save-dev

    npm install dotenv --save-dev

    npm install express --save-dev

    npm install request --save-dev

    npm install http-proxy-middleware --save-dev

</blockquote>

- Finally, you can run the application by entering:
<blockquote>npm run dev</blockquote>
